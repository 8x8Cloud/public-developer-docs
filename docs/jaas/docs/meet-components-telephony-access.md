# Telephony access overview

Quickly connect your self-hosted Jitsi Meet installation to the public telephone network. This service allows you to use 8x8 Jigasi Cloud with your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Create a [JaaS](https://jaas.8x8.vc/) dev account and provide your custom domain address in the [Components section](https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/components).

**Note**: Password protected rooms should use only number-based passwords, so that the dial-in participants can join.

## Installation

To add telephony, follow the steps corresponding to your Jitsi installation type:

* [Docker](/jaas/docs/telephony-access-with-docker)
* [Debian](/jaas/docs/telephony-access-with-debian)
