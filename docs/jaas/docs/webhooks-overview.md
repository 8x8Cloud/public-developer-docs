# Overview

A webhook enables you to obtain notifications from the Jitsi as a Service (JaaS) platform as changes to your data occur. Information is pushed to an endpoint you define rather than pulled from an API. When an event is triggered the JaaS platform sends you a notification as an HTTP **`POST`** request, with a JSON body, to the Webhook endpoint you specify.

Webhooks can be triggered by selected and defined by events that take place during a meeting (in-meeting) or after a meeting has concluded (post-meeting) that are generated by your AppID.

For instructions on defining a webhook, please refer to the [**Webhooks**](/jaas/docs/jaas-console-webhooks) section of the JaaS console.
