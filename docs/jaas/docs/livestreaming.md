# Livestreaming

## Overview

The livestreaming feature in JaaS allows users to broadcast their video conferences to a larger audience by streaming to platforms like YouTube or any other platform that accepts an RTMP stream.

## How to Livestream to YouTube

## Prerequisites

These are the requirements to start using livestreaming:

* Livestreaming is a paid add-on which **require a billing / payment method** to be added to your JaaS Account.
* The current user's **JWT** should enable **livestreaming** to be able to use the feature.

```json
 "features": {
      "livestreaming": true,
      "outbound-call": true,
      "sip-outbound-call": false,
      "transcription": true,
      "recording": true
    },

```
* If you plan to stream to YouTube, you will need a YouTube account in order to start a Livestream on YouTube to send the RTMP stream to. If you are planning to stream on another platform, ensure that it supports an RTMP stream and has a stream key.

Once you open this menu item you should see this box. If you see the warning below, this is due to your YouTube/Google Account not having live streaming setup. You can either select a different account with live streaming set up or you can use the Live Stream Key covered in the section **Option 1) Streaming via Stream Key**.

### Streaming to a Custom RTMP Endpoint (Twitch)

This section will cover how it is possible to stream to a custom RTMP endpoint by using Twitch as an example. 

## Prerequisites

* Livestreaming is a paid add-on which **require a billing / payment method** to be added to your JaaS Account.
* The current user's **JWT** should enable **livestreaming** to be able to use the feature.

## Input Livestream RTMP Endpoint

![](../images/3c92010-image.png)
  

Now in the Live stream key, instead of a YouTube stream key as in the previous section, we will enter an **RTMP endpoint**. 

Since we are using Twitch as an example, you can obtain the RTMP endpoint by visiting their [page](https://help.twitch.tv/s/twitch-ingest-recommendation?language=en_US) to find out the RTMP endpoint closest to you for the best performance. It should follow a format similar to **rtmp://{region}.contribute.live-video.net/app/{stream_key}**

For **{region}** simply select the closest region on the page above. The **{stream_key}** can be obtained from Twitch under your **Creator Dashboard > Settings > Stream > Primary Stream Key**.

## Starting Livestream on Twitch

Once you have the full RTMP endpoint simply enter it into the **Live stream key** field and hit **Start live stream**to begin the stream.

> ðŸ“˜ **Warnings**
> 
> There may be some warnings displayed regarding the **Live Stream key** which you can ignore. It should work with a valid RTMP endpoint provided.
