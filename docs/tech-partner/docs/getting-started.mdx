# Getting started as an 8x8 Technology Partner

## The purpose of this guide

8x8 is proud to provide a cohesive user experience for customers when using 8x8 products. Providing an easy to understand user experience and a consistent UI is essential in achieving that.

This guide helps to style your products to fit within the 8x8 ecosystem allowing a smooth user experience and easy to follow UI.

## Areas of focus when building for 8x8

#### Location

Integrations can be deployed where needed the most but the primary location is the "meta data" panel. It's a place where supporting content or integrations live to help the user complete tasks.

#### Style

The 8x8 design system is called Oxygen. It contains specifications for a large range of web and mobile components with guidance on how to use each one.

#### Accessibility

Accessible products and integrations are important. Any 3rd party integration deployed inside an 8x8 product should be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

#### Theme

8x8 products support switching between dark and light mode so integrations must also support dark and light styles.

## The meta data panel

The meta data panel is a common place where integrations could live inside 8x8. It's a place where supporting content and integrations can help users complete their tasks.

![The meta data panel lives in the right-hand side of the UI and takes up just under half the size of the window. The UI is on a flexible grid so integrations should change width depending on the users screen size.](../images/1200.png)

## 8x8 Notifications

If your integration has notifications we can feed the user events where ever they are in the app so they are aware when something happens.

If your integration supports notifications then here's an explanation of how they would work inside 8x8 and how they can be styled.

![Notifications float in the top right corner of the UI. The user can dismiss or action them once they've seen it.](../images/noti-frame.png)

## Oxygen - 8x8's design system
