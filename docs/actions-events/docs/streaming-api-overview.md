# Streaming API Overview

## General Approach

Generally the Streaming API should be considered only when alternate approaches are not capable of meeting the needs. For general analytic, non real-time even type scenarios the [CCA Realtime], [CCA Historical], [CEX Recent Calls] APIs provide a simpler approach.

When there is a need for real-time event streams or other advanced use cases SAPI is often the appropriate API. It is well adopted and leveraged both by customers, partners and technology partners at scale.

SAPI is intended to be used in a Server to Server or Cloud to Cloud approach and is not intended to be used where a subscription is made from each agents desktop. In cases where there is a need to deliver events to multiple locations/endpoints a central subscription should be made and this should provide an input to a publisher that satisfies the downstream consumers.

## Overview

The SAPI enables you to receive streaming event update information for a Contact Center tenant. You will receive notifications for both agent status and provisioning as well as interactions that occur within your tenant. There is no filter capability all events for all event types are delivered. 

SAPI provides data for real-time events via server push notifications. It uses a Websocket protocol-based event stream and does not use HTTP. Therefore, in order to communicate via WebSocket protocol, you need to maintain a WebSocket connection to the CC platform.

## Accessing the API

## Authentication

In order to subscribe to SAPI events, you must first obtain an authentication token that has been issued for your tenant. This token is a single string that combines your username and password. 

To either obtain an existing or generate a new authentication token:

1. Log into **Contact Center (CC) Configuration Manager**.
2. On the menu, pane go to **Integration** **> API Token**
3. If no tokens are present, click the **New Token** box next to the **Data Request Token** field.

4. Copy the generated **Data Request Token** to your clipboard for authentication use.

**Note**: The generated authentication token for your tenant can be used for your SAPI as well as other 8x8 API requests. It does not expire nor have a time limit unless you decide to change it. If you already have a token and you click on the **New Token** button, your existing authentication token becomes invalid **for all use cases**. You should save a copy in a safe storage location for future reference.

## Subscribing to SAPI

##### Connection Lifecycle Information

Please review the following details before you begin using SAPI:

* Only three SAPI clients per tenant can be connected at a given time.
* If you wish to make more than one distinct connection/subscription you MUST use a unique subscriptionId for each connection. (Max 3 concurrent subscriptions)
* A subscription is valid for 60 minutes after which it will be disconnected.
	+ On disconnect the subscription will cache up to 2 hours of data, reconnecting using the same subscriptionId will deliver all the cached events.
	+ Consumers should reconnect using the same subscriptionId to continue the stream.
	+ If a consumer subscribes with the same subscriptionId more than 2 hours after disconnecting this is treated as a new subscription and no cached events are delivered.

##### Samples and Test Tool

#### The SAPI Sample client

A sample client written in Java is available. This is provided as is as an example of how to consume the SAPI API.

You can receive SAPI event notifications by installing and using the SAPI sample client. The SAPI sample client downloadable [.zip](https://github.com/8x8/files/raw/master/vcc-sapiclient.zip) is provided as a reference implementation only. Please validate this code meets your requirements before using it.

The SAPI sample client is a Java-based command-line utility that facilitates connection to the SAPI endpoint. 

**Note:** SAPI Status codes are displayed as numbers that correspond to the manually selected status code. Agent status codes do not come up with the same status ID number in SAPI if you have more than one status code list. For example, the status code for when one agent is on lunch break may be represented as a different lunch break status code in another different list on the same tenant. 

#### Browser Test Tool

In the SAPI web client, the SAPI query URL in the browser field is constructed as follows:

`[https://vcc-{ccPlatform}.8x8.com/api/streaming/v1/TenantUpdates.jsp](https://vcc-{ccPlatform}.8x8.com/api/streaming/v1/TenantUpdates.jsp)`

Revise your query URL based on the login URL of your Tenant. (Refer to the [Platform URL Guide](https://support.8x8.com/@api/deki/files/2500/Platform-URL-Guide-Virtual-Contact-Center.pdf?revision=4) to retrieve your login URL)

To access your tenant:

1. Click the **Subscribe** button.

The authentication window displays:

![](../images/1a8c4c0-tenant-updates.png "tenant-updates.png")

2. Enter your tenant **User Name** and your **Authentication Token** in the **Password** field and click **OK**.

Following successful connection with the Tenant, the **Tenant Updates** screen displays:

![](../images/2104f74-tenant-update-2.png "tenant-update-2.png")

The displayed **Tenant Updates** screen consists of the following information fields:

* **Subscription ID** - the unique ID for the SAPI connection from the Tenant. Each tenant manages its own subscription ID. Since the SAPI stores messages for a certain period of time (even if the client is disconnected), using the same, consistently named subscription ID is important in order to receive stored messages.
* **Tenant ID** - your 8x8 Tenant ID.
* **Desired Output Type** - can be in either XML or JSON formats.
* **Subscribe** - initiates a subscription to events for the next 60 minutes.
* **Unsubscribe** - disconnects the client from the SAPI server and starts storing messages for possible reconnection.
