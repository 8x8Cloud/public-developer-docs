Welcome to the XCaaS Actions & Events Developer hub. You'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with XCaaS Actions & Events as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck. Let's jump right in!

Actions & Events will allow you to interact with in progress sessions and transactions, get real-time streams.  

You can be up and running pausing a contact center recording, changing the state of an agent, adding records to a campaign or stream events from your contact center as quickly as you can fill our the API request!

You will find [Guides](/actions-events/docs) which describe the APIs and some use cases and [API References](/actions-events/reference) which allow you to test and try the APIs right from this site.
