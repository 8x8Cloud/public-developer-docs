# CC Managing Campaign Status

> ðŸ“˜ **Prerequisites**
>
> * The Campaign MUST be configured as a Dynamic Campaign in Configuration Manager
>

## Authentication

CC Campaign APIs leverage the credentials from the Integration >> API Token area in Configuration Manager.  

These APIs use Basic Authentication.  

The username will be the "Username" value from this screen, it is generally the tenant name  

**For read APIs the Data Request Token will the password**  

**For write APIs the Action Request Token will be the password**  

`Authorization :Basic encodedValue`  

Where encodedValue is base64encode(username:password)
