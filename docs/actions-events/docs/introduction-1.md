# Introduction and Use Cases

The webchat API, also known as Embedded Chat API, allows configuration via the webchat script that meet some of the following use cases.

## Pass customer data into the webchat script from a website

A customer may already be logged into the website, therefore you want to pass across the customer details, as well as details that they are already authenticated into the webchat, so this information can be given to the agent when they accept an interaction, or even passed into the ICA chatbot.

## Trigger the invitation based on an event

When a customer is on a set page on your website, you want to go straight into the webchat invitation to help engage them with a product on that page.

## Custom Branding: Allow extra configuration on the web widget to allow you to meet brand guidelines

A business wants all of the colors on the webchat, including the send, confirm and cancel button to meet their brand guidelines, so using this configuration will help meet that.
