You can filter using [properties](#properties).

To expand the filter view, click on **Advance filter**. Multiple filtering conditions can be applied using **logical operators** such as **`and`** and **`or`** to group them.

Conditions in filters are made of **relation operators** such as **`equals`**, **`not equal`**, **greater than**, **`greater than or equal to`**, **`less than`** or **`less than or equal to`**.

> 📘Note:
>
> Record [**properties**](#properties) contain different data types, so not all relation operators apply.
>
> For example:
>
> * **enums** - only equals or not equals
> * **string** - only equals or not equals
> * **number** - all relation operators
