## [Migrate from version 1 to version 2](/contactcenter/changelog/migrate-from-version-1-to-version-2)


If you used [Chat API V1](/contactcenter/docs/getting-started) you can still use it as [Chat API V2](/contactcenter/v2.0/docs) comes out, version 1 is still supported but deprecated, and we strongly recommend you to migrate and start using the new API as version 1 will be decommissioned in future.
