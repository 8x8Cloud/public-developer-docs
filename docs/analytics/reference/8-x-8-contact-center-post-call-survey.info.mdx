8x8 Contact Center Post Call Survey (PCS) is a questionnaire presented to the caller at the end of a call, typically to collect feedback about the quality of service offered by the company. Companies use a survey to gather feedback from customers and then analyze the collected data to help improve their services. For example, you can get feedback on overall customer satisfaction, how well your service agent performed, and how many calls it took to resolve an issue.
