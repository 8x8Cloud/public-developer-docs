> ðŸ“˜ **Filtering**
> 
> This API is designed with filtering capabilities by using Feed Item Query Language (FIQL) filter expressions.  
> 
> FIQL introduces simple and composite operators which can be used to build basic and complex queries.  
> 
> If the filter is not specified, All objects are returned.
> 
> ***URL encoding notes (FIQL in query params)***
>
> When you pass FIQL in the filter query parameter, reserved characters are URL-encoded by clients/tools:
>
> * %3D = =, %3D%3D = ==
> * %27 = ', %3D%3D%27 = ==â€™
> * %2C = ,
> * %28 = (
> * %29 = )
> * %3B = ;
> * %40 = @
> 
> Most clients encode automatically.
>
> ***FIQL Operators***:
> 
> **Equality & Inequality**
> 
> * `firstName==John` â†’ Contacts with first name 'John'.
> * `firstName!=John` â†’ Contacts without the first name 'John'.
> 
> **Comparisons**
> 
> * `createdTimestamp>25 or createdTimestamp=gt=25` â†’ Contacts created after timestamp 25.
> * `createdTimestamp>=25 or createdTimestamp=ge=25` â†’ Contacts created at or after timestamp 25.
> * `createdTimestamp<25 or createdTimestamp=lt=25` â†’ Contacts created before timestamp 25.
> * `createdTimestamp<=25 or createdTimestamp=le=25` â†’ Contacts created at or before timestamp 25.

> 
> **Logical Operators**
> 
> * `firstName==John;lastName==Doe` â†’ Contacts with first name 'John' AND last name 'Doe'.
> * `firstName==John,lastName==Doe` â†’ Contacts with first name 'John' OR last name 'Doe'.
> 
> **Wildcards**

#### Pagination Parameters

| Name | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scrollId | ID for scrolling through paginated results | String | WyI3YzA4YW0M2RjYTg2YWRiMzg2MDBkNTZhZCJd |
| size | The size of the page to retrieve | Integer | 10 |
| sort | Sorting criteria for the search results | String | name, ASC |
| useScrollId | Indicates if the scroll ID should be used | Boolean | true |

### Pagination

#### Keyset pagination

This pagination method implies searching contacts within a key range(keyset) and the usage of this method requires additional parameters:

* `useScrollId=true`
* `scrollId=WyI3YzA4YW0M2RjYTg2YWRiMzg2MDBkNTZhZCJd`
	+ Received in server response, for first request
	+ You just need to pass it back as request parameter for the next request (a different value will be received for each request). This is empty for the first request.
* `size=10&sort=id,ASC`
	+ It is essential for sorting fields to contain "id" field
	+ Additionally, you can also add sorting by other fields - ex "name"

##### 3. Example Usage

### Without Pagination

#### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.8x8.com/directory-contacts/api/v3/contacts?details=TAG%2CADDRESS%2CPHONE%2CEMAIL%2CEXTENSION&filter=contactType%3D%3D%27corporate%27%3BjobTitle%3D%3D%27Agent%27%3Bemail.email%3D%3Demail.changed%408x8.com' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_CONTACT_SEARCH_API_KEY'

```

> ðŸ“˜ **Request description**
>

### With Pagination

#### Initial Request

When you first request a paginated response, you don't have a scrollId yet. The initial request is sent without it:

```
GET https://api.8x8.com/directoryContacts/api/v3/contacts?size=10&sort=id,ASC&useScrollId=true
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

```

#### Initial Response

```json
{
    "data": [
      // Data not shown here as it's available in the previous example
    ],
    "meta": {
        "hasMore": true,
        "scrollId": "WyI2ODA1MDUyZDc1ZjY0N2E5OTQxYzdiYTJjNDU5ODc5OSJd"
    }
}

```

> ðŸ“˜ **Note**
> 
> The initial response includes a scrollId, which is necessary for subsequent paginated requests. This ID ensures that the subsequent requests fetch the next set of results in the sequence. Remember to use page=0 in conjunction with scrollId for keyset pagination.
> 
> 

#### Subsequent Request with `scrollId`

For the next set of results, you'll use the scrollId provided in the initial response:

```
GET https://api.8x8.com/directoryContacts/api/v3/contacts?page=0&size=10&sort=id,ASC&useScrollId=true&scrollId=WyI2ODA1MDUyZDc1ZjY0N2E5OTQxYzdiYTJjNDU5ODc5OSJd
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

```

#### Subsequent Response

```json
{
    "data": [
      // Data not shown here as it's available in the previous example
    ],
    "meta": {
        "hasMore": true,
        "scrollId": "WyI3YzA4YWM5ZjkxNTU0M2RjYTg2YWRiMzg2MDBkNTZhZCJd"
    }
}

```

##### Rate Limiting

The Contact Search and Contact Management APIs are limited to **60 requests per minute**, in a rolling window, across all the keys under your customer account.

If this limit is exceeded then a **429 Too Many Requests** response code will be returned.
