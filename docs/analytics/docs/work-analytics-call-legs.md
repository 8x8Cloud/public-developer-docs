## Call Legs Explained

A Call Record is a single record view of the overall call and metrics represented by a single Call ID.

A Call Leg provides detailed metrics on an individual segment of a call within the call journey and is represented by a Call Leg ID combined with a Call ID.

Example: A Call Record would be a single row representation of a call that follows the following path which would have multiple Call Legs to fully represent the journey. 

* Inbound to an Auto Attendant
* Transferred to Ring Group
* Simultaneous calls to 5 Ring Group members (Leg per member contacted regardless of outcome)
* Answered by one of the members

[8x8 Work Analytics Historical](/analytics/reference/authentication-1) access is via this multi step process. For any of the endpoints the same process is followed.

> üìò **You will need a working API key to begin**
> 
> You can generate API credentials from [How to get API Keys](/analytics/docs/how-to-get-api-keys)
> 
> The `8x8-api-key` will be the `Key` generated. For Work Analytics the Secret from Admin Console is not required.
> 
> 

Use the following base URL during this process:

* `https://api.8x8.com/analytics/work`

## 1. Authenticate to retrieve access token

You will use your API key combined with the user credentials of a user with permission and access to Work Analytics to authenticate, this user **does not need to be** the one who generated the API credentials

> üöß **User must access Analytics at least once via browser**
> 
> The users credentials will not be able to leverage the API until they have used Work Analytics via browser at least once
>

## Parameters

**Method: POST**

### Headers

| Name | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8x8-apikey | ‚úì | The 8x8-api key provided | test_key_kjdfidj238jf9123df221 |
| Content-Type | ‚úì | Set content type to form-urlencoded | application/x-www-form-urlencoded |

### Body

| Name     | Required | Description                                                        | Example                                             |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| username | ‚úì        | The 8x8 username of a user with Work Analytics access privileges   | [someuser@acme.fakeco](mailto:someuser@acme.fakeco) |
| password | ‚úì        | The 8x8 password of the user with Work Analytics access privileges | Rrnp5QBW6dTbx^TP                                    |

#### Authentication Request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.8x8.com/analytics/work/v1/oauth/token' \
--header '8x8-apikey: {8x8-apikey input here}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'username={8x8 username of user input here}' \
--data-urlencode 'password={8x8 password of user input here}'

```

#### Authentication Response:

**Response**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.yyyyyyy.zzzzzzzzzzz",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800
}

```

**Outputs For Next Step:**

* access_token
* expires_in

The token will expire in the number of seconds specified in expires_in.

The following steps will use the access_token as a Bearer Token form of authentication. This takes the form of the  

`Authorization` header being set to `Bearer access_token` (Space between Bearer and the access_token)

### isConnectTime explained

This looks at the timing of call legs and as such is not valid for call records

if `false` will use 'disconnected_time' of the call leg to filter data and return the result

if `true` will use the 'connected_time' of the call leg to filter data and return the result

**disconnected_time** is when the **call leg** was disconnected from the system

**connected_time** is when the **call leg** transitioned from alerting to connected.

> üëç **Follow the pagination steps below to retrieve subsequent pages.**

#### Pagination

Within Work Analytics Only the /call-records and /call-legs endpoints are subject to pagination.  

This is controlled by `pageSize` and `scrollId`

* `pageSize` is the number of records to return per page and is required for /call-legs
* `scrollId`  is returned from /call-legs requests providing an id for the next page of results.

**Pagination Example**  

Assuming there will be 81 records in total. With an initial input of `pageSize=50` the returned meta data will be as follows.  

Note: data has been truncated to an empty array to limit the size of the example text

```json
{
    
    "meta": {
        "totalRecordCount": 81,
        "scrollId": "c3VwZXJ0ZW5hbnRjc21fMTYzNTU3MTA0ODQ4Nl8xXzE2NDM5MTIzNTI0NDE"
    },
    "data": [
    ]
}

```

The request for the next page would include scrollId set as the value returned in the previous request `pageKey=50&scrollId=c3VwZXJ0ZW5hbnRjc21fMTYzNTU3MTA0ODQ4Nl8xXzE2NDM5MTIzNTI0NDE` 

The new result set would look as follows. The returned result set would only have 31 elements.

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "totalRecordCount": 81,
        "scrollId": "c3VwZXJ0ZW5hbnRjc21fMTYzNTU3MTA0ODM0NV8xXzE2NDM4OTc0OTI5MDM"
    },
    "data": [
    ]
}

```

The request for the next page would be `pageKey=50&scrollId=c3VwZXJ0ZW5hbnRjc21fMTYzNTU3MTA0ODM0NV8xXzE2NDM4OTc0OTI5MDM` the scrollId has been set to the value returned in the previous request

```json
{
    "meta": {
