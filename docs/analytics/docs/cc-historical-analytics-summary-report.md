The base URL is region specific, based on the location of your Contact Center tenant.

* United States: `api.8x8.com/analytics/cc/{version}/historical-metrics/`
* Europe: `api.8x8.com/eu/analytics/cc/{version}/historical-metrics/`
* Asia-Pacific: `api.8x8.com/au/analytics/cc/{version}/historical-metrics/`
* Canada: `api.8x8.com/ca/analytics/cc/{version}/historical-metrics/`
* {version} to be replaced by current Version. As of August 2025 this is 8 resulting in /v8/

## 1. Authenticate to retrieve access token

[OAuth Authentication for 8x8 XCaaS APIs](/analytics/docs/oauth-authentication-for-8x8-xcaas-apis) is used to get a temporary `access_token` for use in with this API

**Outputs For Next Step:**

* access_token
* expires_in

The following steps will use the access_token as a Bearer Token form of authentication. This takes the form of the  

`Authorization` header being set to `Bearer access_token` (Space between Bearer and the access_token)

> 📘 **JSON Examples shown, XML Also available**
> 
> This guide shows all the examples in JSON. It is possible to retrieve responses in XML by specifying the following header

## 2 Multitenancy support

If the API is used for a multitenant customer the requests should contain "X-Tenant-Info" header variable where needs to specify the desired tenantId. The "X-Tenant-Info" header is not mandatory in case of a single tenant customer.

The following error messages could be returned when dealing with a multitenant customer:

* if for a multitenant customer request the *"X-Tenant-Info"* header is not provided the HTTP 400 code along with *"Bad request: X-Tenant-Info header is missing."* message will be returned
* if a wrong tenantId is provided the HTTP 400 code along with *"Bad request: Invalid value for X-Tenant-Info header."* message will be returned

## 3. Get Available Report Types

CC Historical Analytics allows the consumer to get a listing of the available reports including information about their options and available data.

Additional information about each of the reports and detailed definitions of metrics can be found in the [CC Historical Analytics Glossary](https://docs.8x8.com/8x8WebHelp/8x8Analytics/Content/8x8Analytics/Glossary-historical-reports.htm)

**Outputs For Next Step:**  

For the summary reports the response has a number of elements to guide the usage:

* `type` each report type has a unique definition
* `groupBy` each report has one or more groupBy options. This specifies the grouping for the output
	+ `name` this is the name to specify when creating a report with a specific grouping
	+ `filters` these are the available filters for this report type for this particular grouping. The filters available vary depending on the type AND the grouping.
* `metrics` these are the available metrics for the report type. When creating a report. See the [CC Historical Analytics Glossary](https://docs.8x8.com/8x8WebHelp/8x8Analytics/Content/8x8Analytics/Glossary-historical-reports.htm) for additional detail on the definition of the available metrics
* When running reports:
	+ if no metrics are specified: All metrics will be returned
	+ if metrics are specified: ONLY the specified metrics will be returned

The body will be an array as shown below.

* The array will contain one or more objects as described here

	+ **type**: this is the report type and name of the report
	+ **groupBy**: array of options for grouping the report by various dimensions
		- *name*: name of the grouping
		- *filters*: array of the possible filtering options for this grouping for this report
	+ **value**: array of the metrics available for this report

#### granularity

This parameter specifies how to aggregate the report data by time intervals. You must use one of the following values: 15m, 30m, hour, day, week, month, year, or none.

* If the assigned parameter value is none, then the report data is not aggregated by time.
* For date range intervals less than or equal to a week the accepted > - granularities are 15m, 30m, hour, day, or none.
* For date range intervals less than or equal to a month and but longer than a week the accepted granularities are none, hour, day, or week
* For date range intervals longer than a month the accepted granularities are none, month, or year

#### intraDayTimeRange

This parameter is used to specify a time range filter which applies within each day of the report. If this parameter is not specified, data will be returned for the complete time frame described in the mandatory dateRange object.

> 🚧 **intraDayTimeRange minimum size**
> 
> The *end* must be 15 minutes after the start for summary reports and 5 minutes after the start for detailed reports.
> 
> 

* *start*: the start time for the intraDayTimeRange. The format is hh:mm:ss
* *end*: the end time for the intraDayTimeRange. The format is hh:mm:ss

If the requirement is to only see data between 8:30am and 5pm on each day the intraDayTimeRange would be passed as follows

```json
"intraDayTimeRange": 
{
        "start": "08:30:00",
        "end": "17:00:00"
}

```

In version 6 intraDayTimeRange was enhanced to to cover cross-day time range filtering in reports allowing to generate a single report for overnight shifts, and it is available for all aggregated and detailed report types. You can now generate reports for overnight shifts of specific time ranges that cross two days.

With the following example can be generated a report which cover activities for a week but for only time intervals from 20:00 to 06:00 time range.

```json
"dateRange":
{ 
    "start": "2022-08-05T00:00:00.00Z", 
    "end": "2022-08-11T00:00:00.00Z" 
},
"intraDayTimeRange": 
{
    "start": "20:00:00",
    "end": "06:00:00"
}

```

#### filters

Parameter can be completely omitted Or an empty array can be passed for no filtering.

For example report type `queue-interactions-summary` and groupBy `media-and-channel-and-queue` we can chose to not filter at all OR filter by `media` and or `queue`

Each report type has it's own filtering capabilies which can be found in the [Report Types Response](/analytics/docs/cc-historical-analytics-summary-report#report-types-response) each `groupBy` has it's own applicable filters.

no filtersingle queuefilter on multiple queuesfilter on multiple queues and multiple media

```json
  "filters": [
  ] 

```

```
  "filters": [
       {
          "name": "queue",  
          "values": ["103"]
       }
  ]

```

```
  "filters": [
       {
          "name": "queue",  
          "values": ["103", "330"]
       }
  ]

```

```
  "filters": [
       {
          "name": "queue",  
          "values": ["103", "330"]
       },
       {
          "name": "media",  
          "values": ["Phone", "Chat"]
       }
  ]

```

*Notes:*

* When filtering by `media`, if the user also wants to filter by phone direction, instead of using `{"name": "media", "values": ["Phone"]}`, the phone direction can be specified as follows: `{"name": "media", "values": ["OutboundPhone"]}` or `{"name": "media", "values": ["InboundPhone"]}`
* When creating an `agent-interactions-by-wrap-up-code` report type, and the customer wants to filter by `wrap-up-code`, the filter values should be formatted as follows: `{"name": "wrap-up-code", "values": ["<wrap-up-code-list-id>-<wrap-up-code-item-id>"]}`. The `<wrap-up-code-list-id>` and `<wrap-up-code-item-id>` can be found in the CCA UI detailed reports by adding the 'Wrap Up Code List ID' and 'Wrap Up Code ID' fields to the report. For example: `{"name": "wrap-up-code", "values": ["170-1201"]}`

#### metrics

If the requirement is to only have a subset of the the available metrics for the report type, we specify the required metrics

* if no metrics are specified (omitted entirely or empty array) ==> All metrics will be returned
* if metrics are specified ==> ONLY the specified metrics will be returned

 [CC Historical Analytics Glossary](https://docs.8x8.com/8x8WebHelp/8x8Analytics/Content/8x8Analytics/Glossary-historical-reports.htm) provides detail on the definition of the available metrics

```json
"metrics": [
    "accepted",
    "acceptedInSla",
    "acceptedInSlaPercentage",
    "acceptedPercentage",
    "totalAbandoned",
    "totalAbandonedPercentage"
]

```
