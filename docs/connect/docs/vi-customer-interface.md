# Customer Interface

## Overview

When a customer is first invited by an agent to join a call, they will receive an SMS with a link to join a call. Upon clicking onto the link, it will launch their mobile browser where they can use the video conferencing solution to speak with an agent.

## SMS Link

Here is what the SMS Link will look like for the customer.
