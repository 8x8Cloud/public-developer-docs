Add `https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/{subAccountId}/messages` under **WEBHOOK URL**, where **subAccountID** is the Sub-Account ID from your API Keys page which can be found in the **API Keys** menu. **REQUEST BODY** should be the default option which is **JSON Key/Value Pairs**. Now add three new pairs in any order named **source, destination, and text**. The source should be the sender ID which is the name or number you will see when you receive an SMS, the destination is the mobile number in an international format where you are sending the SMS and text is the body message of your SMS. After it’s successfully set up, it should look similar to the image below:
