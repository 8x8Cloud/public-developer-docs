# Usage samples

> ❗️ **Customer Service Window**
> 
> WhatsApp only allows freeform text messages to be sent once a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/#customer-service-windows) has started. A customer service window starts when a user initiates a conversation or when a user replies to a pre-approved template sent by the business.  
> 
> This customer service window lasts 24 hours, and lasts 72 hours if the customer service window is initiated via a [click-to-whatsapp ad](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/ads-that-click-to-whatsapp).  
> 
> Outside of the customer service window, only pre-approved WhatsApp templates can be sent to users.

                            "subType": 1,

                                    "text": "12345"
                                }
                            ]
                        }

In addition, you can also specify a fallback to SMS option which will automatically deliver the message to the user via SMS, if the message cannot be delivered via WhatsApp (such as if the user does not have WhatsApp). It is possible to specify a different body message to fit within the character limit of the SMS message. Please see the section below for details on SMS fallback.

Here is what the corresponding message will look like to the customer receiving the message:

### Customer Flow

Once the customer clicks **View**, they will be taken to a page containing the following information pulled from the business catalog.

* Item Description
* Item Price
* Item URL (as provided in the catalog)

There is also an option to message the business for any questions or clarifications.

![](../images/2e8a5c7-image.png)
Additionally, the customer can choose to **Add to Cart**, which will add the item to a shopping cart.

  

![](../images/7a9a7f4-image.png)
Once the item is added you can view the cart which will take you to the **Place order** screen.

![](../images/ffb3fe4-image.png)
Selecting **Place Order** will send a message to the business with the cart items, so that the business can process the order.

![](../images/15d6b91-image.png)
  

At this point, WhatsApp leaves it to the business to define the next steps for this order, such as requesting address information for delivery or collecting payment information. It is possible for example to use webhooks or Automation Builder to listen for a cart message for a customer and then reply accordingly.

Finally, the **View sent cart** option will allow the customer to confirm what items were purchased in the order.

#### Interactive message with a list of product items from a business catalog

This option can send multiple product items from a business catalog to a customer. This may be useful if there is a collection of items (ex. pants, shirts, hats) that the business is looking to send to a customer.

> ❗️ **Customer Service Window**
> 
> WhatsaApp only allows catalog messages to be sent once a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/#customer-service-windows) has started. A customer service window starts when a user initiates a conversation or when a user replies to a pre-approved template sent by the business.  
> 
> This customer service window lasts 24 hours, and lasts 72 hours if the customer service window is initiated via a [click-to-whatsapp ad](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/ads-that-click-to-whatsapp).  
> 
> Outside of the customer service window, only pre-approved WhatsApp templates can be sent to users.

Here is what the corresponding catalog message will look like.

### Customer Flow

After the customer clicks on **View Items**, it will appear as follows:

![](../images/f874cb1-image.png)
  

The customer can click on an individual item to bring up the single-item page

![](../images/58ab049-image.png)
After selecting **Add to Cart**, the catalog message will now reflect items added to the cart and their amounts.

![](../images/19c4d8e-image.png)
**View Cart** will give the option of seeing the items in the cart and then allowing the customer to **Place Order**.

![](../images/3a25da3-image.png)
After the customer selects **Place order**, this will send a message to the business containing information about the cart.

![](../images/0e1f907-image.png)
At this point, WhatsApp leaves it to the business to define the next steps for this order, such as requesting address information for delivery or collecting payment information. It is possible for example to use webhooks or Automation Builder to listen for a cart message for a customer and then reply accordingly.

**View sent cart** would let the customer confirm the items sent in the cart.

#### Optional: Adding SMS Fallback

If you want to add a fallback to SMS, add the following fields to the "`content`" object in your existing JSON payload. The **fallbackText** will be used instead of the WhatsApp Template Body.

```json
{
  "fallbackText": "This is the text that will be sent in the SMS instead of the WhatsApp Template.",
  "sms": {
    "encoding": "AUTO",
    "source": "<senderId>"
  }
}

```

#### Send Message in Batch

Besides using the Messaging Apps API to send messages individually, you can also send multiple messages with a [single API call](/connect/reference/send-message-many) by defining a **messages** array as in the examples below.

#### Batch WhatsApp template message with Documents

Below is an example of a batch of messages that are using a WhatsApp Template to send documents to different users.

```json
{
    "includeMessagesInResponse": true,
    "messages": [
        {
            "user": {
                "msisdn": "+6511111111"
            },
            "type": "template",
            "content": {
                "template": {
                    "language": "en",
                    "name": "<insertTemplateName>",
                    "components": [
                        {
                            "type": "header",
                            "parameters": [
                                {
                                    "type": "document",
                                    "url": "https://example.com/links/TestPDFfile.pdf"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "user": {
                "msisdn": "+6522222222"
            },
            "type": "template",
            "content": {
                "template": {
                    "language": "en",
                    "name": "<insertTemplateName>",
                    "components": [
                        {
                            "type": "header",
                            "parameters": [
                                {
                                    "type": "document",
                                    "url": "https://example.com/links/TestJSFile.js"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

> 📘 **Different Files / Messages**
> 
> Note that we are sending two different whatsapp messages with different files attached. These messages are being sent to two different recipients.
> 
> 

The first recipient (**+6511111111**) will see this message as a PDF file was defined in their message object.

![](../images/c3ec858-image.png)

The second recipient (**+6522222222**) will see a different message as a different file was defined in their message object.

![](../images/5f665a7-image.png)

This example shows the flexibility of the messages array in that you can customize the message that you send for each recipient.
