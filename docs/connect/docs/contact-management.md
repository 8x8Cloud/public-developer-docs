## Creating contacts

There are two(2) ways to add your contacts, either you bulk upload or enter.

**Steps in creating a single contact**  

*(This assumes you have access to contacts management and that you are already logged in)*

1. On the left navigation menu click "Contacts" and you should be redirected to the Contact Management page as shown below

**Create bulk contacts by uploading a file**  

Our bulk upload method only supports mobile number, first name and last name fields.

1. Start bulk upload, go to Upload contacts tab.

2. Drag the file on the space provided or click the link that says "click to upload". We recommend that you use a .csv file to make sure all your contacts are uploaded.
3. Tag the column where your mobile number is present.

4. You have an option to add your contacts to an existing group. If that group doesn't exist, you can easily type the name and the group will be created automatically once you start processing your file.

3. Click "Save" and that's it, you're done creating your group.

## Blacklisting your contacts

Blacklisting is useful when you want to avoid sending messages to some of your customers. Usual use-case for this is customer subscriptions where some of your customers want to unsubscribe to your marketing messages.

1. Start by selecting a number of contacts from your contacts list.
