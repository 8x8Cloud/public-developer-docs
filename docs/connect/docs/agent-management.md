# Agent Management

## User types

***Agent*** - the most basic role in the application where a user will receive a ticket and start conversing with their customer.

***Supervisor*** - in addition to an agent’s role, a supervisor can view all conversations (accessing “All conversations” menu) and assign tickets to other agents. A supervisor is also able to assign tickets to him/herself. A supervisor can also set the application’s system configurations and manage agents.

***Administrator*** - tickets will not be assigned to users with this permission, therefore they do not directly engage with customers. However they can view or access “All conversations” menu and assign tickets to any agents or supervisors. Like a supervisor, an administrator can set the application’s system configurations and manage agents
