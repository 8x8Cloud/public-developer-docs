## Setup your Gmail trigger

1. Log into your Workato account. Once you are at the dashboard, click Recipes on the menu, and create a new recipe. Select an app and trigger event. The app in our case is Gmail, and our trigger event is “New email” since we want an SMS to be sent with every new email.

2. Next, you will need to link the trigger to a Gmail account. Either choose your account from the drop-down menu or link a new account. After creating the trigger, you may label it for future use.
