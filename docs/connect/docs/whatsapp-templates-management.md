The fields that are available are:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name of the Template | The name that will be used to identify the template |
| Category | The [conversation category](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#conversation-categories) the template falls under. Either Authentication, Marketing or Utility. |
| Language | The language of the template |
| Channel ID | Refers to the WhatsApp Sender ID that is associated with the template. |
| Add Security Disclaimer | Adds a short disclaimer to the end of the message stating:<br>"For your security, do not share this code." |
| Add Expiry Warning (For Authentication Only) | Adds a notice to the message stating when the message expires, typically for OTP codes:<br>"This code expires in X minutes"<br>The number of minutes can be controlled in the same interface. |
| Header | Message Header which can be appended before the body of the message.  |
| Body | The body of the message.<br>By default the message is sent as is with the content provided. For example if the body is "Hello Customer" then the message will be sent exactly as written.<br>For dynamic content, you can use bracketed numbers such as `{{1}}` `{{2}}` to represent dynamic content that can be substituted into the message template. This is useful when using the message template as a part of an API call so that you can dynamically substitute.<br>For example you may have a template such as "Hello `{{1}}`, Your code is `{{2}}`" where in your API call you can provide "Chris" for `{{1}}` and "100" for `{{2}}` so the final message will be "Hello Chris, Your code is 100". |
| Footer | Small text appended to the bottom of a message. |
| Buttons | Used in certain types of message to specify two message types:<br>- Call to Action<br>- Quick Reply<br>- OTP |

Once you submit the message for approval, you can use the existing template page to check on it's status and whether it is approved an able to be used with your WhatsApp Sender ID through 8x8.
