# Voice Call Action Webhook

Call action events prompt the customer to take an action to change the call flow. Your "Voice Call Action" (VCA) endpoint can be configured on the sub-account level with the IVR product[Webhooks](/connect/reference/create-a-new-voice-webhook).The structure of the Call Action event object is identical to that of [Call Status](/connect/reference/call-status) event. However the expected response is different.

## Call Action Request (IVR)

8x8 platform will POST a JSON object to your URL.
