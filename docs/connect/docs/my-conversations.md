#### Understanding ticket statuses

There are six standard statuses that can be applied to a ticket. The ticket status can be assigned manually by an agent/manager OR automatically by the system:

| Status | Description | Manual/Auto |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *New* | **-** The original status of all new tickets created in the system, no action has been taken by agents.**-** Not visible or editable to agents. Administrations and supervisors are able to view all 'New' tickets in 'All' tickets.**-** New tickets are not yet assigned to any agents. | *Auto* |
| *Open* | **-** Any ticket, which have been assigned, re-opened or currently assigned | *Auto* |
| *Pending* | **-** A ticket that have been opened but pending for customer reply | *Manual* |
| *On Hold* | **-** Agent is unsure about the ticket or waiting for information internally | *Manual* |
| *Resolved* | **-** An agent marks a ticket at his own discretion; anytime he/she feels the customer query has been answered | *Manual* |
| *Closed* | **Automatically assigned by the system upon the following triggers:**<br>- Completion of designated holding time by tickets marked as Resolved<br>- Completion of designated holding time by tickets marked as Pending | *Auto* |
