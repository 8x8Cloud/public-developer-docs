## Setting up Zendesk for the Integration

### Tag Setup

In order to filter by the tickets sent by 8x8, you will need to create a **Zendesk Tag**. To create the tag, you can assign a new tag by clicking the "Tags" field of an existing ticket. This can be any ticket in the system, but you will need to assign it the tag you wish to use to create it in the system. The tag can be removed from the ticket afterwards.

The tag can be any value, however for this tutorial we are assuming you are using a tag called **ChatApps**. If you choose to use a different value, please note that the tutorial will show ChatApps where your tag would be instead.

### Create Zendesk API Token

In order to give 8x8 access to the Zendesk API, you will need to generate an API token. Return to the **Admin Center**, then in the sidebar navigate to **Apps and Integrations** > **APIs** > **Zendesk API**. In the next screen agree to the Zendesk Terms and Conditions and click **Get Started**.![](../images/dfc6015-image.png)

Once on this screen, check the button for **Token Access** to enable it. Afterwards click "**Add API Token**"

![](../images/f10d84a-image.png)

Once you are shown your API Tokens value, record it as you will need to send this information to our team to enable your Zendesk integration.

![](../images/dbc00b4-image.png)

#### Send Information to 8x8 to Enable Zendesk Integration

After completing all of the steps above, the setup should be complete on your end. Now send an email to [cpaas-support@8x8.com](mailto:cpaas-support@8x8.com) with the title "Enable Zendesk Integration" and provide the following details:

a. URL, the path to customer zendesk api: https://{YOUR_SUBDOMAIN}.zendesk.com/api/v2

b. Email, of user who will be used to access zendesk, required permissions: create and  

update tickets, create end users. This is the email registered in your Zendesk.

c. ApiToken, your Zendesk ApiToken for the user with the previous email address.

d. TicketTag, Ticket tag which will be automatically added to tickets created by Zendesk  

broker (chatapps, for instance)

e. DefaultTicketSubject, the subject which will be used for new ticket when the discussion starts  

from the image, not from the text message.

#### Using the Integration

Once your integration is setup properly, you should be able to receive a message in your ChatApps channel and a ticket with your tag will automatically generated on Zendesk.

Here is an example WhatsApp message that is sent to the WABA associated with an 8x8 Subaccount.

![](../images/daa69a3-image.png)

To check for the reply, you can view the tickets automatically generated from the view you created.

![](../images/b46c8fb-image.png)

Here is what the ticket will look like once in a conversation. The messages from the Zendesk Agent are under "Customer Service Agent (Rommel Sunga) and then replies from the customer are under "Rommel Sunga".

![](../images/f3c1d9a-image.png)

The customer service agent can send replies as "Public Reply" and those messages will be sent to the customer.

![](../images/4ee018b-image.png)

This will show up as a reply on the customer's WhatsApp.

![](../images/6a1f35b-image.png)

Once the issue is resolved, the agent can mark the ticket as solved.![](../images/16cde57-image.png)

> ðŸ“˜ **Solved Tickets**
>
> Note that by default, when a customer replies again to your WABA, their replies will go to the existing ticket unless the existing ticket even if it is solved.
>
> You can choose an action as per your requirements, for example to mark the ticket as **Open or In Progress** when this occurs by creating a Triggers in the Zendesk Admin Center.
>
>

New Message coming into a ticket after the ticket was solved.

![](../images/4ae8825-image.png)

The message comes in from the customer, but the ticket remains solved.

![](../images/589a792-image.png)

This example trigger will set all tickets tagged with ChatApps to pending for example, if a new reply comes in after they are solved.
