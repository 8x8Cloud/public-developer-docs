# Simple IVR


Below is a sample of a simple IVR call scenario. The Callflow below demonstrates an example scenario where a callback is placed to a customer seeking technical support. Then in the same call the user has the ability to either contact a member of technical support, end the call or repeat the main menu.


## Demo Video


This video will show a demo of how the Advanced IVR menu will work, including showing webhooks and the Initial API Call.

## GitHub Repo with Sample Backend Code


In order to make use of the Callflows API, you will need to setup not only Webhooks but a backend server to respond to those webhooks. We have provided a code sample of backend code in Python that processes the webhooks and responds to them to trigger actions in the IVR.


Note: The code for the Simple IVR is under app\_simple\_ivr.py

## Diagram of Simple IVR Flow


Below is a description of the IVR Tree that we will be building with this call scenario. There are 3 possible paths and only 1 level in this simple IVR Tree.

## Webhooks and API Calls in Simple IVR Flow


Below is a diagram of how the webhooks and API Calls from your server will work with the 8x8 Voice Platform to create this IVR.

## Example of initial API call to place outbound call


This is the URL to send the initial API request to.


`POST voice.wavecell.com/api/v1/subaccounts/{sub-account-id}/callflows` - v1.2


This is the request body to send the API request to as well. Note, you will need to replace the source with a 8x8 virtual number in your account and destination with a destination phone number to call.

    "callflow": [
          {
            "action": "makeCall",
            "params": {

        {
          "action": "sayAndCapture",
          "params": {
              "promptMessage": "Dear customer, Thank you for contacting Xyz technical support recently. If you have resolved your issue already, press one. Or press two to speak to an agent.",
              "voiceProfile": "en-US-BenjaminRUS",

              "speed": 1,
              "minDigits": 1,
              "maxDigits": 1,
              "digitTimeout": 10000,
              "overallTimeout": 10000,
              "completeOnHash": false,

              "successMessage": null,
              "failureMessage": "Invalid input, please try again"
              }
        }
    ]
}

```

### Example Response Body for an Callflows API request.


Below are examples of successful and failure responses to the API request above. Depending on the error the status message may change.


**Success**


```json
{
    "sessionId": "d9874358-89ac-4c50-bbab-1eb634482a94",
    "sessionStatus": "CREATED",
    "callFlowRequestId": "89b545a5-0676-11ee-8100-d500c0d203fc",
    "statusCode": 1,
    "statusMessage": "Created"
}

```

**Failure**


```json
{
    "sessionStatus": "NOT_CREATED",
    "callFlowRequestId": "0564e804-0a7e-11ee-9c83-6df9c048a122",
    "statusCode": -1002,
    "statusMessage": "Speech profile or language parameter invalid"
}

```

### Explaining Session Status in Callflows Response Body


Session status indicates if a call is successfully accepted & created or not created on the 8x8 platform. 8x8 returns two status:


* `CREATED`- call is successfully created on the platform.
* `NOT CREATED`- call is not successfully created on the platform and 8x8 returns `statusCode` and `statusMessage` to understand why the call was not accepted on the platform

## VCA Webhook Example


Once the initial call is made and the user responds with a DTMF input, the server will be sent a [VCA](/connect/reference/voice-message-copy#voice-call-action) webhook which will contain the DTMF input as part of the response body:


```json
{
  "payload": {
    "eventId": "ddc1e44a-9a40-11ee-b7e9-838e846e8a11",
    "callId": "d6333b3f-9a40-11ee-b57c-09a88813d857",
    "sessionId": "d62f91ba-9a40-11ee-945e-5f476b4334a1",
    "subAccountId": "InternalDemoCPaaS_8dD15_voice",
    "callStatus": "DTMF_RECEIVED",
    "callDirection": "OUTBOUND",
    "callType": "PSTN",
    "source": "+6391111111111",
    "destination": "+6599999999",
    "sourceFormat": "MSISDN",
    "destinationFormat": "MSISDN",
    "sourceCountryCode": "PH",
    "destinationCountryCode": "SG",
    "callDuration": 0,
    "dtmf": "3",
    "sipCode": 200,
    "timestamp": "2023-12-14T05:23:08.406Z"
  },
  "namespace": "VOICE",
  "eventType": "CALL_ACTION",
  "description": "Action request of a call"
}

```

This will allow your server to identify the DTMF input and reply with a callflow as the [VCA](/connect/reference/voice-message-copy#voice-call-action) webhook response. Below are examples of Callflow responses. Responding to the VCA webhook with one of these callflows below will trigger the corresponding action.


### DTMF Input 1 - Hangup


Responding with the callflow below will immediately end the call.


Digit 1
```json
{
    "callflow": [
          {
          "action": "hangup"
        }
    ]
}

```

### DTMF Input 2 - Connect Call


Responding with this callflow will connect the existing call to a different number.


Digit 2
```json
{
    "callflow": [
          {
          "action": "makeCall",
          "params": {
            "source": "6512345678",
            "destination": "6561115777"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

### DTMF Input Other - Repeat Menu


Responding with this callflow will repeat the main menu.


Any Other Digit
```json
{
    "callflow": [
          {
          "action": "sayAndCapture",
          "params": {
              "promptMessage": "Sorry, we did not understand your response. If you have resolved your issue already, press one. Or press two to speak to an agent.",
              "voiceProfile": "en-US-BenjaminRUS",
              "repetition": 1,
              "speed": 1,
              "minDigits": 1,
              "maxDigits": 1,
              "digitTimeout": 10000,
              "overallTimeout": 10000,
              "completeOnHash": false,
              "noOfTries": 2,
              "successMessage": null,
              "failureMessage": "Invalid input, please try again"
              }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Voice Session Summary Webhook


Upon termination of the session the session summary([VSS](/connect/reference/session-status)) will be returned via webhook. To learn more about the Voice Session Summary, please [click here](/connect/reference/session-status).
