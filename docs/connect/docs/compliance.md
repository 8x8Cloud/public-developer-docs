## Opt-in & opt-out

All RCS messaging must follow opt-in best practices:  

• Users must explicitly consent (opt-in) before receiving RCS messages.  

• You must document and maintain proof of consent (e.g., timestamp, source).  

• Include an option to opt-out (e.g., responding STOP) in your campaign design.  

• For interactive flows, use suggested replies for opt-out (“Stop”, “Unsubscribe”).
