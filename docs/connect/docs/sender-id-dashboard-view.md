# Dashboard View

**Linked View**  

By default, Sender ID Dashboard presents a “Linked View” where we display the Sender ID registration by country (destination country that the sender ID wanted to be registered towards)

**Ticket View**  

Hovering over the column next to LOA would display “View ticket” which would allow accessing the support ticket that is associated with the particular Sender ID registration.

**Expanded Link View**  

Click on the arrow on the right side of the specific sender ID registration (as highlighted by the box in red). This allows user to track registration by mobile operator
