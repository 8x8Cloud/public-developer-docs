**An agent marks a ticket as ON HOLD**  

(A) In the case where the agent is waiting for internal information, he can continue chatting with customers once information is obtained.  

(B) In the case the agent is unable to resolve the issue, he has to notify the manager and the manager will manually reassign the ticket directly to another agent. This will mark the ticket as OPEN once assigned.  

(C ) Alternatively once an agent replies to the ticket it should automatically be set to OPEN.

**An agent marks a ticket as PENDING**  

(A) A period of time (default set to 1 hour, but configurable by managers) lapsed starting from the time of the agent's last message. This leads to the ticket automatically marked as CLOSED.

## Adding notes

There are two types of notes that you can add during a conversation, these notes can only be read by agents regardless of their role. Notes are useful where the next agent can review previous issues regarding the ticket or the customer. It will help resolve tickets faster.

**Internal notes** - these are notes that can be generated by the system or notes that other agents might add during their call. These notes are useful whenever a ticket is assigned to another agent.

**Customer notes** - these are notes that can be added by agents during the call where they can add more information about the customer. These are useful when a customer engages with other agents either from the same ticket or a new one.
