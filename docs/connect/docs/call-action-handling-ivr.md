# Call Action Handling (IVR)

## Responding to Call Action Request


To start your call flow you need to reply to the call action request with an HTTP 200 response code including a Call Action in the HTTP response body. The supported Call Actions are:


* `makeCall` - Initiates an outgoing call to the desired destination. This function should be used to connect the first call with another party.
* `say` - Generates and plays a TTS to the calling user.
* `sayAndCapture` - Plays a voice file in to the call and then captures users DTMF input and reports back the DTMF via Voice Call Action (VCA) webhook.
* `playFile` - Downloads the sound/voice file provided and plays it back in the currently active call.
* `hangup` - Disconnects all active calls. This will terminate the session, triggering the session summary webhook.


## makeCall


This function should be used to connect the first call with another party.


The following is an example of the JSON response you would need to provide:


```json
{
   "clientActionId": "ivr1_level2",
   "callflow": [
      {
         "action": "makeCall",
         "params": {
            "source": "6512345678",
            "destination": "6587654321",
            "callRecording": true //Optional. Use only if call recording has been set up.
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

The action should contain the following parameters:




| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| action | String | MakeCall â€“ Action to Connect/Bridge call between two users |
| destination | String | Number of the called party in E.164 format (The second user's number). |
| source | String | Number of the calling party in E.164 format. This should be the Virtual Number allocated to your sub-account |
| callRecording | Boolean | (Optional) Trigger to start recording the IVR session. Before using this option please reach out to your Account Manager since this option might include additional costs. Additionally please make sure that the Call Recording has been configured on your account. To configure call recording please take a look at [Call Recordings](/connect/reference/call-recordings) |


## say
