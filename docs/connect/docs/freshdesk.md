---

#### 2. Under Ticket Updates, letâ€™s create a new rule called "ChatApps new public comment"

![freshdesk-2](../images/a44c114-Freshdesk_2.png "Freshdesk 2.png")

---

![freshdesk-4](../images/e5dc813-Freshdesk_Config_1.png "Freshdesk 4.png")

* Your URL should be:  

`https://chatapps.8x8.com/webhook/freshdesk/{ChanelId}?accessKey={accessKey}`

* {ChanelId} and {accessKey} will be sent to you.
* For example: `https://chatapps.8x8.com/webhook/freshdesk/1234-abcd-1234-abcd?accessKey=123456789`

* Your JSON content should be:

```json
{ 
"event": "AgentComment", 
"ticketId": "{{ticket.id}}"
}

```

---

#### 4. Under Ticket Updates again, letâ€™s create another rule called **ChatApps status changed**

---

#### **5. Letâ€™s configure the following fields:**

**URL is the same as the above**

#### Your JSON now should be

```json
{
"event": "StatusChanged", 
"ticketId": "{{ticket.id}}", 
"ticketStatus": "{{ticket.status}}"
}

```

---

#### 6. Once this is done, you will need to send to 8x8 the following information

* **URL**, the path to customer Freshdesk API:https://{YOUR_SUBDOMAIN}.freshdesk.com/api/v2
* **ApiToken**, your Freshdesk ApiToken, of an admin user.
* **TicketTag**, which will be added to tickets created by 8x8 (Chat Apps, for instance)
* **DefaultTicketSubject**, ticket subject which will be used for a new ticket starting from an incoming message

> ðŸ“˜ **Optional Step**
>
> If you would like to send an automatic message to your users, when closing a ticket, you can use the instructions below to set it up.
>
>

 **Automatic Closing Message**

* Create a new Automation rule under "Ticket Updates" Category
* Set the correct tag and rules (tag should be consistent to what you used in other rules)
* Select Trigger webhook - POST on `https://chatapps.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/{{subaccountid}}/messages`
  * please replace {{subaccountid}} with your `subaccountId`which can be found in [8x8 Connect](https://connect.8x8.com/messaging/api-keys)
* custom header: `{"Authorization": "Bearer YprcJ**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***","Content-Type": "application/json"}`  

*8x8 Bearer token can be found in the API Keys section of your [8x8 connect](https://connect.8x8.com) account*

**Your JSON advance body:**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "msisdn": {{ticket.requester.mobile}}
  },
  "type": "Text",
  "content": {
    "text": "Thanks for your reaching out, your ticket {{ticket.id}} is now closed"
  }
}

```

You can modify the "text" field above to include any message and use any [FreshDesk ticket field](https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/52630-understanding-dynamic-content-and-placeholders).
