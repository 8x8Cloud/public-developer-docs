A branch is a specific type of step, allowing you to split your workflow definition, based on a condition.
Here is an example of branch:

```json
{
    "id": "step_1",
    "stepType": "Branch",
    "selectNextStep": {
        "branch1": "{{isCountryCode(data.payload.user.msisdn, 'SG')}}",
        "branch2": "{{isCountryCode(data.payload.user.msisdn, 'US')}}",
        "branch3": null
    }
}
```

As you can see, the *stepType* is *Branch*.

In this case, you need to define the next steps and the condition.
This can be done using *selectNextStep* and by listing the branches.
You can use any branch name (here we used the names *branch1*, *branch2* and *branch3*).

The branch names defined here will be used as the step id for the following steps.
In the example above the next step will start with "id": "branch1",

Inside each branch, you need to define a condition, for more detail, see the **Scripting** section below.

In the example above, we are creating the following logic:
- branch1 will be selected if the source number has a Singapore country code
- branch2 will be selected if the source number has a US country code
- branch3 will be selected otherwise
