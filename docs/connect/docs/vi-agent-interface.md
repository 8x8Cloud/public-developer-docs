Each agent will receive an invite via email and have their own login details.  

In the case of facing issues logging in, please try ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù and follow the onscreen instructions.

## Placing a Call

From the home screen, an agent can place a call by clicking on the **"Start a Call"** button.

This will open a dialog box with two fields:

- **Phone Number:** The customer phone number to send an SMS invite to.
- **Enter a Call Reference:** This is so you can enter a unique string (such as "customer_call_2") which would be associated with this call. This used not only in the VI User Interface Call Log but also in the API when you want to later refer to a call.

Once the invitation is placed, the agent will see this pop up screen while they wait for the customer to accept the call.

When the customer opens the invitation link to the call, the pop up screen will be updated and the agent will be automatically connected to the call.
