## Prerequisites

* **8x8 Account** with an SMS Engage form created
  * If you do not have an SMS engage form, see the **SMS Engage Form** section below on how to obtain one.
* **8x8 API Key**
  * Please see [this](developer-tools) page on how to create API Keys if you do not have an existing one.

---

## SMS Engage Form

You must have at least one SMS Engage form created for you by 8x8. SMS Engage forms are created based on your use-cases. Once they are created, 8x8 will provide you a **surveyId** and \*_url_ac\*.

* Please note that the variable url is your default SMS Engage link which 8x8 has set up for you (e.g. [http://smstoweb.net?sid=1234](http://smstoweb.net?sid=1234)). The url is shortened once the message has been sent.
  * The shortened url is always **21 characters** in length.
* If you want to get the data via **Webhooks**, simply provide us a specific url where we will post the data.
* For more information on **how to create an SMS engage form** please contact your account manager or send an email to [8x8 Support](mailto:cpaas-support@8x8.com).

## Send Single SMS Engage Survey

The 8x8 SMS Engage survey method expects requests sent by developers to respect a specific format.

In the following section, we are going to go over the different elements of the request:

* URL format
* Authentication
* Data payload

At the end of the section, we will generate a cURL command to send an SMS Engage directly from the command line.

### Request URL

* As detailed in the [Send SMS Engage survey](/connect/reference/survey-send) , the URL is defined by the following pattern: `https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/{subAccountId}/surveys/{surveyId}/messages`
  * The **{subAccountID}** should be replaced by your own 8x8 Subaccount ID and the **{surveyId}** should be replaced by your Survey ID in a request.

### Authentication

Use your **API Key** in the **Authorization** header of your HTTP request, this is denoted with the  variable below.

```bash
curl --location 'https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/<subaccount>/surveys/<surveyId>/messages' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <apiKey>' \

```

### Data payload

The API expects to receive a structured request containing the SMS data in a specific format. As detailed in the documentation, the data that we have to submit should be a JSON object.

To send a **single SMS Engage** message here is an example of a data payload:

```json
{
  "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
  "templateBody": "Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. {{url}} Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok.",
  "templateVariables": {
    "firstName": "James",
    "order_nr": "ABC1000"
  },
  "source": "<sourceVnOrSenderId>"
}

```

The JSON parameters are explained in the table below:

| Parameter | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| destination | Mobile Number in international format | +6512345678 |
| templateBody | Template of message to user. It should have the variable **{{url}}**, this variable will be substituted in the SMS by the link set for you by 8x8. | Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. {{url}} Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok. |
| templateVariables | Variables or pre-defined fields used inside the templateBody. Your url should have the value or link set for you by 8x8. | "templateVariables": {<br>"firstName": "James",<br>"order_nr": "ABC1000"<br>}, |
| Source | The Sender ID or Virtual Number to send the SMS from. | Acme |

### Sending the API Request

Now that the API request is setup correctly you need, let’s try this by using cURL. If you are running **Mac OS**, **cURL** is already installed. Just run the **Terminal** app (Located under Applications->Utilities).

For **Windows** based machines click [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/installing-and-using-curl/) on how to install curl.

Alternatively you can use **Postman** if you are familiar with the tool as well to send this request.

For **cURL** the command should look as follows, which can also be adapted into Postman.

```bash
curl --location 'https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/<subaccount>/surveys/<surveyId>/messages' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <apiKey>' \
--data '{
  "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
  "templateBody": "Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. {{url}} Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok.",
  "templateVariables": {
    "firstName": "James",
    "order_nr": "ABC1000"
  },
  "source": "8x8"
}'

```

Remember to replace the **,** and  values above. The **{{url}}** value does not need to be included in the te**mplateVariables** and will be automatically substituted by 8x8.

This should result in a SMS being sent similar to the one below with the URL replacing the {{url}} parameter's place in the SMS Body.

![image](../images/6f385ec-image.png)
A successful request should return an 200 OK HTTP Response Code and the Response Body should appear as below:

```json
{
    "umid": "<umid>",
    "clientMessageId": null,
    "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
    "encoding": "GSM7",
    "status": {
        "code": "QUEUED",
        "description": "SMS is accepted and queued for processing"
    }
}

```

Note that **mobileNumber** and **umid's** values will be replaced with your request's unique values.

## Send Batch SMS Engage Survey

Now that we have covered how to send a Single SMS Engage Survey, there may also be times that it is appropriate to send multiple SMS Engage Surveys in a single API request. For those use cases, we can use the [SMS Engage Batch API Endpoint](survey-send-many).

In the following section, we are going to go over the different elements of the request:

* URL format
* Authentication
* Data payload

At the end of the section, we will generate a cURL command to send an SMS Engage directly from the command line.

### Request URL

* As detailed in the [Send SMS Engage survey](/connect/reference/survey-send) , the URL is defined by the following pattern: `https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/{subAccountId}/surveys/{surveyId}/messages/batch`
  * The **{subAccountID}** should be replaced by your own 8x8 Subaccount ID and the **{surveyId}** should be replaced by your Survey ID in a request.

### Authentication

Use your **API Key** in the **Authorization** header of your HTTP request, this is denoted with the  variable below.

```bash
curl --location 'https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/<subaccount>/surveys/<surveyId>/messages/batch' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <apiKey>' \

```

### Data payload

The API expects to receive a structured request containing the SMS data in a specific format. As detailed in the documentation, the data that we have to submit should be a JSON object.

To send a **batch SMS Engage** message here is an example of a data payload:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Igor",
        "order_nr": "1010101",
        "age": 24
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    },
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Petr",
        "order_nr": "1010104",
        "age": 20
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    },
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Vasia",
        "order_nr": "1010102",
        "age": 22
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    }
  ],
  "template": {
    "source": "YourBrand",
    "templateBody": "Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok: {{url}}"
  },
  "clientBatchId": "MyBatch00001",
  "includeMessagesInResponse": true
}

```

The JSON parameters are explained in the table below:

| Parameter | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| messages | Contains an array of at minimum templateVariables and destinations | {<br>"templateVariables": {<br>"firstName": "Petr",<br>"order_nr": "1010104",<br>"age": 20<br>},<br>"destination": ""<br>}, |
| template | Template of message to user. It is required to contain a **templateBody** that should have the variable **{{url}}**, this variable will be substituted in the SMS by the link set for you by 8x8.<br><br>**Source** should also be included which is the Sender ID or 8x8 Virtual Number to send the SMS from.  | "template": {<br>"source": "YourBrand",<br>"templateBody": "Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok: {{url}}"<br>}, |
| clientBatchId | Custom string to associate with this batch of messages. | MyBatch001 |
| includeMessagesInResponse | Whether to include the details of each individual message in the HTTP Response. | True |

### Sending the API Request

Now that the API request is setup correctly you need, let’s try this by using cURL. If you are running **Mac OS**, **cURL** is already installed. Just run the **Terminal** app (Located under Applications->Utilities).

For **Windows** based machines click [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/installing-and-using-curl/) on how to install curl.

Alternatively you can use **Postman** if you are familiar with the tool as well to send this request.

For **cURL** the command should look as follows, which can also be adapted into Postman.

```bash
curl --location 'https://sms.8x8.com/api/v1/subaccounts/<subaccount>/surveys/<surveyId>/messages/batch' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <apiKey>' \
--data '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Igor",
        "order_nr": "1010101",
        "age": 24
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    },
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Petr",
        "order_nr": "1010104",
        "age": 20
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    },
    {
      "templateVariables": {
        "firstName": "Vasia",
        "order_nr": "1010102",
        "age": 22
      },
      "destination": "<mobileNumber>"
    }
  ],
  "template": {
    "source": "YourBrand",
    "templateBody": "Hello {{firstName}}, your order is {{order_nr}}. Please check and confirm if your scheduled delivery time is ok: {{url}}"
  },
  "clientBatchId": "<batchId>",
  "includeMessagesInResponse": true
}'

```

Remember to replace the  **,** **,** and  values above. The **{{url}}** value does not need to be included in the **templateVariables** and will be automatically substituted by 8x8.

This should result in a SMS being sent similar to the one below with the URL replacing the {{url}} parameter's place in the SMS Body.

![image](../images/5ece359-image.png)
A successful request should return an 200 OK HTTP Response Code and the Response Body should appear as below.

HTTP Response

```json
{
    "batchId": "<batchUmid>",
    "clientBatchId": "<batchId>",
    "acceptedCount": 3,
    "rejectedCount": 0,
    "messages": [
        {
            "umid": "<umid>",
            "clientMessageId": "<batchId>/<mobileNumber>",
            "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
            "encoding": "GSM7",
            "status": {
                "code": "QUEUED",
                "description": "SMS is accepted and queued for processing"
            }
        },
        {
            "umid": "<umid>",
            "clientMessageId": "<batchId>/<mobileNumber>",
            "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
            "encoding": "GSM7",
            "status": {
                "code": "QUEUED",
                "description": "SMS is accepted and queued for processing"
            }
        },
        {
            "umid": "<umid>",
            "clientMessageId": "<batchId>/<mobileNumber>",
            "destination": "<mobileNumber>",
            "encoding": "GSM7",
            "status": {
                "code": "QUEUED",
                "description": "SMS is accepted and queued for processing"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

You should receive multiple messages in the **messages** array assuming you set **includeMessagesInResponse** as **true** in the request body. If it was set to **false** then the **messages** array will be **null**.

Note that the **batchUmid**, **batchId**, **mobileNumber** and **umid's** values will be replaced with your request's unique values.

## Survey Appearance

The webpages for the surveys are built by the 8x8 team for each customer based on their inputs. A few example pages are included below as they would appear in a mobile browser. They can include both text box and multiple choice type of questions.
