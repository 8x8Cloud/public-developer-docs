# Steps

## Overview

**Steps** make up a **workflow definition**. Each step has a unique id that identifies it within that workflow definition. This page aims to define each type of step and the properties that make up that step to better understand how they can be used as part of a workflow definition. 

Steps allow you to create custom workflow definitions that can perform different actions within that workflow instance.

## List of Steps

| Step Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SMS Message | SMS step allows you to send a message to a recipient as a SMS. | Send an SMS message to a customer. |
| ChatApps Message | ChatApps Message step allows you to send a message using 8x8 Chat Apps messaging API. | Send a ChatApps message to a customer. |
| Wait | Wait step allows you to make the workflow wait for a specified period of time before executing the next step. | Wait 2 hours to send a reminder message to a customer. |
| Branch | Allows you to create multiple paths in a workflow. | Use a Branch step to decide what message to send based on a customer's reply. If a customer replies with 1, send a reminder message. If they reply with 2, send a different message. |
| WaitForReply | The WaitForReply step type allows your workflow to pause till you receive a reply from an end user | Wait till a customer responds to a message. You can pair it with a branch step to decide what to do based on that response.<br>For example you may want to send a message asking a user to check their email for an OTP, then use Wait for Reply to wait for the user to input the OTP before proceeding to the next step. |
| Voice Message | Send a Voice Call to a number | Play a voice message to a specified phone number with a reminder. |
| HTTP Request | Send an HTTP request to an endpoint. Useful for integrating with APIs. | This may be useful to query an HTTP endpoint and use the value returned as part of the flow. For example you can query the Google Calendar API for available meeting slots and use the slots as part of a message response for a user. |
| Jump To | Skip to another step in the workflow definition. This is often useful to better organise your workflow definition. | For example there may be a menu with many options and some of them refer to the same message such as:<br>1) Office Hours of Restaurant Location 1<br>2) Office Hours of Restaurant Location 2<br>3) Office Hours of Restaurant Location 3<br>If 1+2 are the same, you can use a Jump Step to point to a message that would contain the same message. |
| Send to Converse | Send the current conversation to [Converse](/connect/docs/converse-overview) for an agent to take over. | As part of a menu, you can give the option for the user to escalate to a live agent. |

## Step Descriptions

## SMS Message

SMS step allows you to send a message to a recipient as a SMS using the 8x8 SMS API.

![Example of Step Properties](../images/0eccbeb-image.png)Example of Step Properties

| Property | Description | Example Value |

| Sender ID | Either the SMS Sender ID or the Virtual Number that the message will be sent from and the user will see. | 44703492340 (Number that is tied to the subaccount123) |
| Destination | The Phone Number that you would like to send the SMS to. | `{{data.payload.source}}` (If the workflow was triggered by an inbound message, this variable would refer to the sender of that inbound message). |

## ChatApps Message

ChatAppsMessage step allows you to send a message using 8x8 Chat Apps API.

## Wait

Wait step allows you to make the workflow wait for a specified period of time before executing the next step.

(Note: The duration is yet to be updated, that's why it shows 00:00:00 on the left)

| Property | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step Name | Unique name that identifies a step. | wait_6686 |
| Duration | Duration to wait before proceeding onto the next step | 5 hours |

## Branch

Allows you to create multiple paths in a workflow.

The example below shows the next steps after and before the branch to illustrate it's use. 

* The Wait For Reply Step (waitforreply_8622) just before this is waiting for a input from a user
* The Branch Step (branch_8338) checks the value returned in the Wait For Reply Step
	+ If 1, chatappsmessage_0501 step is executed, delivering the message "Please enter your email address:"
	+ If 2, chatappmessage_9836 step is executed, delivering the message "Goodbye".

| Value to check | This allows you to refer to a previous step in the workflow definition and the value it contains.  | Use the value a user inputted in a Wait For Reply Step as part of the branch logic |
| Keywords to Compare | Fixed values to check the property "Value to Check" against. | You can add 1, 2, 3 as values to compare to create a menu such as the following:<br>1) Enter 1 to reserve a table<br>2) Enter 2 for restaurant hours<br>3) Enter 3 for location |

## Wait For Reply

The WaitForReply step type allows your workflow to pause till you receive a reply from an end user.

For example you may want to send a message asking a user to check their email for an OTP, then use Wait for Reply to wait for the user to input the OTP before proceeding to the next step.
