The 8x8 Voice API lets you programmatically **make and control calls** using **JSON callflows**.

A single callflow model powers multiple voice products and patterns, including:

- **Voice Messaging** (TTS and pre-recorded audio playback) — [Voice Messaging – Guide](/connect/docs/voice/voice-messaging/voice-messaging-guide)
- **IVR** (DTMF menus via `sayAndCapture`) — [IVR – Introduction](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/ivr-introduction)
- **Outbound reminders, collections, and callbacks** — built using callflows + webhooks (start with [Send Callflow](/connect/reference/ivr-send-callflow))
- **Number masking (call bridging)** — two-leg call bridging patterns (start with [Getting started with Number Masking](/connect/docs/voice/number-masking/getting-started))
- **Voice apps integrated with your backend via webhooks** — [Voice Call Action webhook guide](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/voice-call-action-webhook-guide)

## The core endpoint:  Send Callflow

All voice experiences start by sending a callflow to a subaccount:

`POST /api/v1/subaccounts/{subaccountId}/callflows`

**What it does**
- Starts a voice session and executes the callflow actions in order.
- The first action must be `makeCall` (this originates the first call leg and creates the session).
- Returns an immediate response indicating if the request was accepted.

**API Response (immediate)**

The Send Callflow API returns an immediate response with:
- **sessionStatus**: `CREATED` (request accepted) or `NOT_CREATED` (request rejected)
- **sessionId**: Unique identifier for the session (if created)
- **statusCode**: Numeric code indicating the result
- **statusMessage**: Human-readable message explaining the status

Example success response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "d9874358-89ac-4c50-bbab-1eb634482a94",
  "sessionStatus": "CREATED",
  "statusCode": 1,
  "statusMessage": "Created"
}
```

Example failure response:

```json
{
  "sessionStatus": "NOT_CREATED",
  "statusCode": -1002,
  "statusMessage": "Speech profile or language parameter invalid"
}
```

> **Note:** This immediate response tells you if your request was **accepted**, not the final call outcome. For end-of-session results (answered, busy, failed, etc.), use the [Voice Session Summary webhook](#vss--voice-session-summary-authoritative-final-outcome).

**Understanding Session Status**

The `sessionStatus` field tracks a voice session through its lifecycle:

1. **Initial status** (API response):
   - `CREATED` - Request accepted, session initiated
   - `NOT_CREATED` - Request rejected, check `statusCode` and `statusMessage` for reason

2. **Final status** (in VSS webhook after session ends):
   - `COMPLETED` - Call answered and completed successfully
   - `FAILED` - Call failed (busy, no answer, invalid number, etc.)
   - `CANCELLED` - Session cancelled before completion

**Where to track session status:**
- **Immediate status:** Check API response `sessionStatus` (tells you if request was accepted)
- **Progress status:** Use VCS (Voice Call Status) webhook for real-time updates (optional)
- **Final status:** Use VSS (Voice Session Summary) webhook for authoritative end-of-session outcome

**Example flow:**

```text
1. POST /api/v1/subaccounts/{id}/callflows
   → Response: {"sessionStatus": "CREATED", "sessionId": "abc123"}

2. Call in progress...
   → VCS webhook: {"status": "RINGING"} (optional, if configured)
   → VCS webhook: {"status": "ANSWERED"} (optional, if configured)

3. Call ends
   → VSS webhook: {"sessionStatus": "COMPLETED", "sessionId": "abc123"}
```

- [Advanced IVR](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/advanced-ivr-guide)

> **Note:** Number Masking does NOT use the Send Callflow API. Number Masking sessions start with inbound calls to virtual numbers, and your backend responds to [VCA webhooks](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/voice-call-action-webhook-guide) with callflow JSON to bridge the call.

> Note: Any API request that uses a `source` (caller ID / CLID) requires **CLID whitelisting**. See the note on the Send Callflow reference page.
> If you need CLID enablement, follow the standard support path listed in the API reference.

## Callflows:  what they are

A **callflow** is an ordered list of actions executed by the voice platform.

Common action families include:

- `makeCall`: originate a call leg (starts the session)
- `say`: play TTS into the call
- `playFile`: play an audio file (MP3/WAV hosted on HTTP/HTTPS URL)
- `sayAndCapture`: play a prompt and capture DTMF input (IVR)
- `hangup`: terminate the call/session

**API reference**
- [Callflow Actions](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/call-action-handling) — authoritative action list + parameters.

**Guides**
- [Voice Messaging – Guide](/connect/docs/voice/voice-messaging/voice-messaging-guide)
- [Simple IVR](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/simple-ivr-guide)
- [Advanced IVR](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/advanced-ivr-guide)

## Error codes (how to debug fast)

Voice errors typically show up in two places:

1) **Synchronous API errors** when sending a callflow (invalid schema, invalid parameters, authorization issues).
2) **Asynchronous runtime outcomes** (no answer, busy, routing/provider failures) delivered via callbacks/session outcomes.

Use the error guides by product:

- **IVR & Voice Messaging error codes**
  [IVR and Voice Messaging error codes](/connect/docs/voice/error-codes/voice-status-codes)

- **Number Masking error codes**
  [Number Masking error codes](/connect/docs/voice/error-codes/number-masking-error-codes)

**How to use these effectively**
- Start from your request and response: [Send Callflow](/connect/reference/ivr-send-callflow)
- Correlate with callbacks and final outcome:
  - For interactive flows: [Voice Call Action webhook guide](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/voice-call-action-webhook-guide)
  - For end-of-session outcomes: [Voice Session Summary](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/voice-session-summary-webhook)

## Webhooks: how voice apps become dynamic

Webhooks allow the platform to call **your backend** to deliver events such as:

- **DTMF results** from `sayAndCapture` (IVR selections)
- **call progress / call status** events (when configured)
- **end-of-session summaries** (final outcomes)
- **virtual number lifecycle events** (number provisioning, configuration changes)
- **recording availability / recording status** notifications (when enabled)

Start here:
- [Voice Call Action webhook guide](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/voice-call-action-webhook-guide)
- [Webhooks Overview](/connect/docs/voice/webhook-guides/webhooks-overview)

### Webhook types you'll use (and what each one is for)

Webhook type is chosen when you configure the webhook destination for your **subaccount**.

#### VCA — Voice Call Action (interactive control point)

**Use it for**
- IVR menus and any scenario where your backend must decide "what's next" during a live call.

**Typical triggers**
- `sayAndCapture` completes and delivers **DTMF digits**.
- Other in-call action decision points depending on your flow.

**What you do**
- Parse the payload (DTMF/event data).
- Respond with the next callflow step (continue menu, branch, bridge, or hang up).

- Setup: [Webhook Setup Guide for IVR](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/webhook-setup-guide-for-ivr)
- Example: [Simple IVR](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/simple-ivr-guide)

#### VSS — Voice Session Summary (authoritative final outcome)

**Use it for**
- Reliable end-of-session record for analytics, reconciliation, retries, and customer reporting.

**What you do**
- Treat this as the final outcome signal.
- Persist results keyed by `sessionId`.
- Correlate outcomes with the relevant error code guides.

- Payload Reference: [Session Summary (Voice Messaging)](/connect/docs/voice/voice-messaging/session-status)
- Payload Reference: [Session Summary (IVR)](/connect/docs/voice/ivr/session-summary)

#### VCS — Voice Call Status (progress telemetry)

**Use it for**
- Near-real-time progress updates (ringing/answered/disconnected), especially for UI status or live monitoring.

**What you do**
- Log as timeline telemetry (idempotent, best-effort, do not assume ordering).
- Do not use as the final source of truth (use session summary for final outcomes).

Link:
- Reference: [Call Status (Number Masking)](/connect/docs/voice/number-masking/call-status)

#### VNU — Virtual Number Updated (number lifecycle events)

**Use it for**
- Track lifecycle events for virtual numbers assigned to your subaccount (number provisioning, configuration changes, deactivation).

**What you do**
- Update your internal number inventory when virtual numbers are added, modified, or removed.
- Sync number availability for inbound routing, masking pools, or customer assignments.

Link:
- Guide: [Virtual Number Updated Event](/connect/docs/virtual-number-updated-event)

#### VRU — Recording notifications (recording status / availability)

**Use it for**
- Recording workflows where you need a callback when recording assets are available or upload completes.

**What you do**
- Update your systems when recording status changes.
- Optionally query recording status endpoints for verification.

- Reference: [Create a new recording push config](/connect/reference/create-a-new-recording-push-config)
- Reference: [Get recording status information](/connect/reference/get-recording-status-information)

### Webhook configuration endpoints (API Reference)

All voice webhooks are configured per subaccount:

- List existing webhooks
  `GET /api/v1/subaccounts/{subaccountId}/webhooks`
  → [Get webhook information](/connect/reference/get-webhooks-information)

- Create a webhook (choose type:  VCA/VSS/VCS/VNU/VRU)
  `POST /api/v1/subaccounts/{subaccountId}/webhooks`
  → [Create a new webhook](/connect/reference/create-a-new-webhook)

- Delete a webhook by type
  `DELETE /api/v1/subaccounts/{subaccountId}/webhooks/{webhookType}`
  → [Delete a specific type of webhook](/connect/reference/delete-a-specific-type-of-webhook)

## Production building blocks (APIs you'll likely use next)

Once you can send callflows and handle webhooks, these APIs help you productionize:  provisioning numbers, choosing voices, enabling recordings, and exporting logs for reconciliation.

### Virtual Number Management API (number inventory / assigned numbers)

**What it's for**
- List and validate virtual numbers assigned to a subaccount (useful for inbound flows, DID ownership checks, masking pools, and operational monitoring).

**When you need it**
- Your solution requires a virtual number (e.g., inbound IVR, inbound masking callback numbers, or managing a pool per customer/subaccount).
- You want to validate whether a number belongs to a given subaccount before using it in callflows.

**API reference**
- List numbers:
  - [Get My Virtual Numbers](/connect/reference/get-virtual-numbers)
