# Getting started with Contacts API

Our Contacts API will help you manage your contacts through our RESTful api endpoints.  
It will allow you to:

- Create a single contact or batch of contacts
- Update information about a particular contact
- Delete a single contact or batch of contacts
- View a contact's information
- Create a contact group and add contacts to that group
- Blacklist a group of contacts

  and more just to name a few.

## Server Regions

To ensure the use of the correct data center region, it is necessary to modify the base URL to correspond with the provisioned region of your account. Refer to the table below for the appropriate base URL associated with each data center region.

For more information on data center regions, please visit the following [page](/connect/docs/data-center-region#api-endpoints-and-platform-region).
