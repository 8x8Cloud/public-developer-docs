## Suggested Actions

Suggestions in RCS Business Messaging provide interactive buttons, chips, or quick replies that guide users seamlessly through rich conversational experiences. By using suggestions, brands can streamline user journeys, enhance engagement, improve conversions, and gather immediate user feedback.

### Available Suggestion Types

| Suggestion type | One-line description | Typical brand use cases | Core benefit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Suggested Reply** | Sends a predefined text back to your agent or bot. | *Yes/No*, choose size/colour, CSAT ‚Äúüëç/üëé‚Äù, OTP confirmation. | Keeps flow structured and speeds funnel completion. |
| **Dial a Number** | Opens the dialer with a preset phone number. | Escalate to live agent, click-to-call for abandoned carts, fraud alerts. | Instant voice escalation builds trust and saves high-value sales. |
| **View a Location** | Launches maps focused on a given pin or search term. | Store locator, nearest ATM/locker, travel itinerary. | Drives measurable footfall from messaging. |
| **Open URL / Webview** | Opens browser or in-app webview (full/half/tall). | Secure checkout, product page, claim form, loyalty sign-in. | Seamless upsell without forcing an app download. |
| **Create Calendar Event** | Pre-fills a calendar entry in the user‚Äôs default calendar. | Doctor appointments, flight reminders, webinar invites. | Cuts no-shows by embedding reminders directly in the calendar. |

### Best practices

* Limit to 4‚Äë5 suggestions per message to avoid cognitive overload.
* Use clear, action‚Äëoriented labels (e.g. ‚ÄúTrack Order‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù).
* Always set postback data so downstream systems can act on replies.
* Include capability fallback (SMS or URL) when the user‚Äôs client does not support a given action.
* Instrument analytics to track tap‚Äëthrough and optimise suggestion wording.
