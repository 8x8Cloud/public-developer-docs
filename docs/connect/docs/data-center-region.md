## Setting your Platform region

* **New Account creation.** The most relevant data center to your location is automatically preselected during the new account creation process. However, we understand that your business needs may vary, so we provide you with the flexibility to modify the data center selection during that process. This empowers you to choose the location that would best align with and benefit your specific business requirements.
* **Migrate existing account** *(available only to Enterprise accounts)*. Customers that have longâ€“term contracts, account managed (enterprise) or purchase a significant amount of credits every month*(USD 10,000/month or more)* can email their account managers or our [support team](mailto:cpaas-support@8x8.com) to request a migration of account data to another geographical region.

## API Endpoints and Platform Region

To ensure optimal API performance, it is essential to select the appropriate base URL for API calls corresponding to the data center region where your account is provisioned.

**The key advantages of correctly specifying the data center region include**:

* **Latency/Network Advantages:** Reduced latency in API calls is achieved when your server, initiating the API calls, is geographically closer to the selected data center region of your account.
* **Data Isolation:** Complying with data residency requirements is facilitated by using the appropriate URL for your API calls, ensuring that data and logs associated with the API calls are stored in the designated region.

Here is a list of available regions and their corresponding base URLs. Replace `{product}` with the relevant product name you are using. The `{product}` placeholder supports several subdomains: `sms`, `verify`, `smpp`, `lookup`, `contacts`.

| Platform Region | API Base URL |
| --- | --- |
| Asia Pacific (default) | https://{product-name}.**8x8.com** |
| Europe | https://{product-name}.**8x8.uk** |
| North America | https://{product-name}.**us.8x8.com** |
| Indonesia | https://{product-name}.**8x8.id** |

For example, if your account is provisioned in the Indonesian region, use `https://sms.8x8.id` for your SMS API calls instead of the default `https://sms.8x8.com` which will ensure you are connecting to the Indonesian data center region directly.
