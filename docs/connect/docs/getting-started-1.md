## RCS Business Messaging Agent Launch Process

  

**Agent Creation & Brand Profiling**

Begin by submitting your agent details to 8x8 using the RCS Agent Request Form. This information should include:  

• Brand Information: Legal name, website, and primary point of contact.  

• Agent Display Elements: Brand logo, color scheme, and tagline.  

• Use Case Description: Outline the primary purpose of the agent (e.g., customer support, promotional messaging).

8x8 will utilise this information to create your RCS agent profile. Once created, thoroughly review the agent’s display features and functionality to ensure alignment with your brand identity and messaging objectives.

  

**Agent & Brand Verification**

After approving the agent profile, 8x8 will initiate the verification process, which involves:  

• Proof of Ownership: Providing documentation that confirms your authority over the brand.  

• Compliance Review: Ensuring adherence to RCS messaging guidelines, including opt-in/opt-out processes and content standards.

This verification is conducted in collaboration with authorised vetting partners and may require additional information depending on regional regulations.

  

**Platform Review & Launch Authorisation**

Upon successful verification, 8x8 will submit your agent for review to Google and relevant mobile network operators or partners. This review assesses:  

• Use Case Validity: Ensuring the agent’s purpose aligns with acceptable RCS use cases.  

• Compliance with Guidelines: Verifying adherence to content and interaction standards.

Approval timelines may vary based on the complexity of the use case and regional considerations.

  

**Agent Preview & Testing**

Before full deployment, it’s essential to test the agent’s functionality. This can be achieved by:  

• Internal Testing: Using test devices to interact with the agent and verify message flows.  

• Preview Submission: Providing a demonstration (e.g., video walkthrough) of the agent’s interactions, including opt-in and opt-out processes.

These steps ensure the agent operates as intended and complies with all necessary guidelines.

  

**Go-Live & Monitoring**

Once approved, your agent will be activated for live messaging. Post-launch, it’s crucial to:  

• Monitor Performance: Track message delivery rates, user engagement, and other key metrics.  

• Maintain Compliance: Regularly review content and interactions to ensure ongoing adherence to RCS guidelines.
