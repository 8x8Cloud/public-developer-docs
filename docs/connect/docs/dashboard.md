### Time period

This is the section where an admin or supervisor can view the stats within a selected period of date and specific agent. By default, it shows all of the agents’ stats. Users can select a specific agent to view his/her stats.

**Stats includes**  

*Created* - total number of tickets created  

*Resolved* - total number of resolved tickets  

*Closed* - total number of closed tickets  

*On-hold* - total number of tickets that were put on hold

If you have more tickets closed than created during a period, it means that you are clearing backlogs (closing tickets created before the period). If you have more created than closed tickets, then your backlog (tickets not closed) is growing during the period.
