# Channel based queueing

Channel based queuing allows you to match agents with your customers to a specific channel(Viber, WhatsApp, WeChat etc...). 

* A familiar use case is grouping agents into specific channel(s) if you have different Chat Apps channels enabled under Converse. Agents can address some issues or inquiries faster because of channel specificity.
