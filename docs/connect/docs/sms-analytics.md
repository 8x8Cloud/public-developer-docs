| Total | Total amount of messages sent/received in the time period. |
| Sent | Total amount of messages sent in the time period. |
| Total Chargeable | Total messages charged by 8x8 in the time period. |

| Undelivered | We have received confirmation that the message was not delivered. This can be due to various reasons such as:<br>1. Mobile handset is unavailable (e.g. mobile is switched off or on roaming mode)<br>2. Filtered out by the operator |
| Rejected | The message has not been accepted by our platform. This can be due to some errors such as incorrect mobile numbers or insufficient credit. You will not be charged for rejected messages. |
| Received | The message has been received by our platform and it is currently being processed before being sent to the carrier. |
| Delivery Rate | Percentage of SMS messages with a status of delivered. |
| Cost | Cost of Each Message. |

### SMS Conversions

This reports page allows you to see conversions relevant to the [Verification API](https://developer.8x8.com/connect/reference/verification-api-get-started), specifically for SMS sent using the service.

The main graph will show how many SMS have been sent using the service over time and what percentage have been successfully converted. This is useful for OTP use cases to track if there are any OTP conversion issues for example.

There is also a more detailed reports section on the same page which will show a detailed breakdown of the status of each verification attempt, conversion rate and cost. You can also export the report as a CSV file as well.
