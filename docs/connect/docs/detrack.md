# Detrack - SMS Integration

## Introduction

**Detrack** is a scalable, smart, and easy to use tracking service with automatic real-time notifications when orders are delivered.

**Detrack** provides a rule-based email and text / SMS notification feature, that allows users to send email and text messages to customers, company staff, or any other person who needs to receive those messages based on event triggers.

With this integration, we can leverage the Detrack event triggers and 8x8 API to send SMS when an event occurs.

## Configuring your Detrack Notifications

3. Select the **Events** that will trigger the notification. In this example we select a completed event.
4. Select the **Group** that you wish to filter. If no Group is selected, then notifications are sent for all jobs regardless of Group.

## Customizing text / SMS notifications

1. Go to the **Text / SMS** tab.
2. For the **Send Text / SMS to** option, select the field containing the mobile number that you wish to notify when the event is triggered. This field is **optional** – you can choose not to send any text by not selecting any field.
3. If you wish to notify other recipients such as internal staff or 3rd party contractors, enter their mobile numbers (one per line) in the **Other Fixed Numbers** box provided. This field is **optional** – you can choose not to send any text to others by leaving the field empty.
4. Type your customized text message in the **Text / SMS body** field.
5. A tracking link will be included in your text message after the text body. The link, when tapped on smartphones, will send the recipients to a direct tracking page where they can easily track the status of their deliveries. The recipients will also be able to rate the Goods / Service, the Driver, as well as provide feedback regarding the delivery to you.
6. Click **Save and send a text notification** button to send a sample text notification to the test phone number or click **Save** to save your settings.
