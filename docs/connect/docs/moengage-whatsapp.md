1. Sender Name (*Mandatory*): The Sender Name is a name you want to provide to the Sender profile so that you can recognize this easily while using it to create a campaign inside MoEngage. The Sender Name should be between 5-50 characters.
2. WhatsApp business number (*Mandatory*): It is the phone number registered with WhatsApp Business Platform via 8x8, using which you want to send out WhatsApp Messages to your users.

3. Click on the template that you'd like to use on MoEngage to preview the contents of the template. If you don't have any already, you will need to create them.
