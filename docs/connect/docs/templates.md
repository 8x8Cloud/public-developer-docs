# Templates

This section will cover how to manage templates within the 8x8 Connect Dashboard. There are primarily two types of templates:

* **SMS Templates:** This covers SMS templates which can be used within the Multichannel Sender features in 8x8 Connect.
* **Messaging Apps Templates:** This covers WhatsApp Templates on the Dashboard for now, although other Messaging Apps channels may be added in the future.

Please see the corresponding pages in this section for further information on each type of template.
